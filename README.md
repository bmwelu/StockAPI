# Asp.Net Core 2.2 API

My goal is to learn (or refresh up on):

    Asp.Net Core 2.2
	
	Authentication
	
	Automapper
	
	Versioning
	
	CORS
	
	Entity Framework
	
	Postman
	
	Azure Logging

## TODO

CORS is done sloppy; must harden

Create database, use entity, save stock watch symbols

Role based authentication

New user registration

Refresh tokens. (If token expires while still using, app will force to resignin.)
